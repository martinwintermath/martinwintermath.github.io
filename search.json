    "title": "The double kissing problem",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Famously Isaac Newton and David Gregory disagreed over the maximal number of disjoint unit spheres that can simultaneously touch a central unit sphere. Newton claimed it to be 12, while Gregory thought that a 13-th sphere can fit. It took several centuries to show that Newton was right. Here is your chance to be part of a dispute just like that: make you guess for the double kissing problem. \n\nThe kissing number is the maximal number of disjoint (3-dimensional) unit spheres that can touch a common central unit sphere. Today we know the answer is 12. Some optimal solutions have noticable gaps between the outer spheres (see the right figure below) which made people wonder whther a 13-th sphere could fit.\n\nThe double kissing problem replaces the central sphere with two spheres:\n\nGiven two touching unit spheres, what is the maximal number of disjoint unit spheres that can be arranged so that each touches at least one of the central spheres?\n\nIt is not hard to come up with an arrangement of 18 spheres by cutting out a part of the fcc lattice (or A3 lattice):\n\nAs of writing this article, it seems that a 19-th sphere cannot made fit.\nHowever, in 2015 Moritz Firsching found that by shrinking the outer spheres by a tiny amount, to a radius of not less than 0.99, we actually can fit a 19-th sphere! Here is an animation of this arrangement based on coordinates provided by him on MathOverflow:\n\n\n\nWhile I am still rooting for double kissing number 18, this 19-sphere arrangement made me pessimistic regarding the existence of a slick argument for this.\nThe double kissing problem was initially brought to my attention by Florian Theil. In his paper “Face-Centered Cubic Crystallization of Atomistic Configurations” with Lisa Flatley they showed that the fcc lattice is (asymptotically) an energy minimizer for suitably chosen 2- and 3-point potentials. 2-point potentials (that is, the energy depends on the distance between pairs of particles) are familiar from the classical electrostatic and gravitation forces. In contrast, 3-point potentials (the energy depends on the distances in triples of particles) struck me as less natural (though Florian explained to me that they are not unphysical). In fact, Flatley and Theil conjecture that the 3-point potentials are actually not necessary for their result. They can prove this conditional on a new Conjecture 2.2, which reads (in my words):\n\nConjecture (Flatley, Theil, 2015)  Given a packing of unit sphere in which each sphere touches exactly 12 other spheres, then for any pair of touching spheres there are at least four spheres that touch both of them.\n\nIf the double kissing number were 18, then this would answers their conjecture affirmatively: let \\(B_0,B_1\\) be two touching spheres in an arrangement as in the conjecture, and let \\(N_i\\) be the set of spheres touching \\(B_i\\) (excluding \\(B_{1-i}\\)) then \\(|N_i|=11\\), \\(|N_0\\cup N_1|\\le 18\\), and\n\\[|N_0\\cap N_1| = |N_0|+|N_1|-|N_0\\cup N_1| \\ge 11+11-18 = 4.\\]\nTheir Conjecture 2.2 makes much stronger assumptions than the general double kissing problem and might therefore be more accessible. Note that in the animation of the 19-spheres configuration, there is not a single sphere that touches both central spheres. This is possible since the central spheres are not touched by 12 spheres each, but by 11 and 10 other spheres respectively (including the other central sphere)."

    "text": "I taught this TCC course on “Polytope Theory” starting from October 10th 2022 for 8 weeks. Due to the nature of TCC courses (being streamed to several universities) this was an online course taught via MS Teams.\n\nIntroduction\nPolytope Theory is the study of (convex) polytopes, the generalization of polygons (2D) and polyhedra (3D) to general dimension. Besides their geometric nature as convex sets, polytopes possess a rich combinatorial structure, making them exceptionally accessible by combinatorial techniques. The study of polytopes reaches from the antiquity (starting from the Platonic solids), over the 19th/20th century (understanding polytopes in 3D and initializing the study of polytopes in dimension \\(\\ge 3\\)), until today, where we understand that the richness of polytopal phenomena starts in dimension 4 and which led to findings such as universality. The subject has shown proximity to algebraic geometry, representation theory, analysis, optimization and many more.\n\n\nScope\nIn this course I aimed to give an overview of this very diverse subject and cover selected topics with focus towards research and open questions. I tried to cover the following, though not everything made it into the final course:\n\n\nrealization spaces and universality\n\n\nGale duality and enumeration of combinatorial types\n\n\nface numbers, Dehn-Sommerville equations and the Upper Bound Theorem\n\n\nreconstruction from the edge graph\n\n\nspectral theory of polytopes, expansion and Izmestiev’s Theorem\n\n\ngeometry and combinatorics of 3-dimensional polytopes\n\n\ninscribability and related geometric constraints\n\n\nsymmetry properties of polytopes\n\n\nzonotopes\n\n\nthe polytope algebra\n\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\nBesides an elementary geometric understanding, the prerequisites are minimal:\n\n\nlinear algebra\n\n\nelementary graph theory: basic definitions (sub-graph, vertex degree, bipartite graph), connectivity, handshaking lemma, planar graphs, etc\n\n\nbasic convex geometry: convex sets and cones, hyperplanes, some central theorems (Carathéodory’s theorem, hyperplane separation theorem) though we will give ample reminders for these\n\n\nbasic combinatorics: mostly some counting coefficients\n\n\nbasics of partially ordered sets, lattices, etc\n\n\nNot strictly necessary, but a background in any of the following will provide motivation and can help the understanding at some points: linear/convex optimization, algebraic topology, real representation theory of finite groups.\n\n\nLiterature\n\n\nB.
