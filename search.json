You can also find the course on Moses.\n\nDescription\nRigidity is a classical topic inspired from physics, engineering and architecture; but at the same time full of questions with intrinsically mathematical appeal and beauty.\nClassical rigidity theory studies frameworks which are graphs that are embedded in Euclidean space with straight-line edges. One should think of them physically as built from rigid metal rods that are connected at universal joints. The central question of rigidity theory is whether a given framework is flexible (it can be deformed in such a way that all its edges stay of the same length) or rigid (it cannot be deformed in this way). Questions of this nature have a long history in structural engineering, but are also surprisingly ubiquitous in pure mathematics. The question for rigidity turns out intricat, and so many tools have been developed to deal with it, either approximately or in special case. Today mathematicians study many different forms of rigidity (infinitesimal, global, universal, generic, minimal, …) and many different settings for rigidity (bar-joint frameworks, point-hyperplane frameworks, volume rigidity, but also rigidity of manifolds and polytopes). The subject is intrinsically geometric, using tools from and inspiring results in algebraic geometry, projective geometry, hyperbolic geometry and convex geometry.\nIn this lecture we start with an introduction to the classical rigidity theory of frameworks which still underlies all modern developments. Beginning from the core definitions we explore the first- and second-order theory. We will take a look at different forms and setting for rigidity, such global and generic rigidity, and also point-hyperplane frameworks and some other forms of rigidity. In the second part of the lecture we focus specifically on rigidity questions that arise in the geometric study of polytopes. Here we take a look at classical rigidity results by Cauchy, Dehn, Gluck, Alexandrov and Minkowski, but also modern developments and their connection to Wachspress Geometry.\n\n\nScope\nThe first half of the lecture (roughly week 1 – 8) will focus on the classical rigidity theory of frameworks. The second half (roughly week 9 – 16) will explore the rigidity theory of polytopes. My goal is to talk about the following topics:\nFrameworks\n\nfundamental concept: frameworks, tensegrities, flexes, rigidity (local, global, universal)\nfirst-order theory: infinitesimal flexes, stresses, rigidity matrix, projective invariance\nsecond-order theory: stress matrix, second-order rigidity, prestress stability, energy interpretation\ngeneric rigidity, Maxwell counting condition, rigidity matroid , Laman graphs\nglobal rigidity and generic global rigidity\nframeworks on the sphere, cylinder etc.\ncross-bracing theorems\npoint-hyperplane frameworks, volume rigidity\nsymmetry-forced rigidity, reduced counts, pure symmetry rigidity\n\nPolytopes\n\nrigidity theorems of Cauchy, Dehn and Gluck; Connelly’s flexible spheres, bellow theorem\npolyhedral frameworks, Tutte embeddings, reciprocal frameworks, the Maxwell-Cremona correspondece\nrigidity of triangulated surfaces\nrigidity of non-triangulated surfaces with coplanarity constraints\nconed polytope frameworks, the Wachspress-Izmestiev stress, stress-flex conjecture\nuniqueness theorem’s of Alexandrov, Minkowski, etc.\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\nThe prerequisits are minimal. I will assume a good grasp of linear algebra and some fundamental graph theory (connectivitiy, planarity, handshaking lemma, etc). For the second part of the lecture some background knowledge on polytopes (definition, combinatorics) can be advantageous, but we will also recall the essentials.\n\n\nLecture notes\nI do not intend to provide lecture notes consistently.

    "title": "The double kissing problem",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Famously Isaac Newton and David Gregory disagreed over the maximal number of disjoint unit spheres that can simultaneously touch a central unit sphere. Newton claimed it to be 12, while Gregory thought that a 13-th sphere can fit. It took several centuries to show that Newton was right. Here is your chance to be part of a dispute just like that: make your guess for the double kissing problem.\n\nThe kissing number is the maximal number of disjoint (3-dimensional) unit spheres that can touch a common central unit sphere. Today we know the answer is 12. Some optimal solutions have noticable gaps between the outer spheres (see the right figure below) which made people wonder whether a 13-th sphere could fit.\n\nThe double kissing problem replaces the central sphere with two spheres:\n\nGiven two touching unit spheres, what is the maximal number of disjoint unit spheres that can be arranged so that each touches at least one of the central spheres?\n\nIt is not hard to come up with an arrangement of 18 spheres by taking a part of the fcc lattice (or A3 lattice):\n\nAs of writing, it seems that a 19-th sphere cannot made fit.\nHowever, in 2015 Moritz Firsching found that by shrinking the outer spheres by a tiny amount, to a radius of not less than 0.99, we actually can fit a 19-th sphere! Here is an animation of this arrangement based on coordinates provided by him on MathOverflow:\n\n\n\nWhile I am still rooting for double kissing number 18, this 19-sphere arrangement made me pessimistic regarding the existence of a slick argument for this.\nThe double kissing problem was initially brought to my attention by Florian Theil. In his paper “Face-Centered Cubic Crystallization of Atomistic Configurations” with Lisa Flatley they showed that the fcc lattice is (asymptotically) an energy minimizer for suitably chosen 2- and 3-point potentials. 2-point potentials (that is, the energy depends on the distance between pairs of particles) are familiar from the classical electrostatic and gravitation forces. In contrast, 3-point potentials (the energy depends on the distances in triples of particles) struck me as less natural (though Florian explained to me that they are not unphysical). In fact, Flatley and Theil conjecture that the 3-point potentials are actually not necessary for their result. They can prove this conditional on a new Conjecture 2.2, which reads (in my words):\n\nConjecture (Flatley, Theil, 2015)  Given a packing of unit sphere in which each sphere touches exactly 12 other spheres, then for any pair of touching spheres there are at least four spheres that touch both of them.\n\nIf the double kissing number were 18, then this would answers their conjecture affirmatively: let \\(B_0,B_1\\) be two touching spheres in an arrangement as in the conjecture, and let \\(N_i\\) be the set of spheres touching \\(B_i\\) (excluding \\(B_{1-i}\\)) then \\(|N_i|=11\\), \\(|N_0\\cup N_1|\\le 18\\), and\n\\[|N_0\\cap N_1| = |N_0|+|N_1|-|N_0\\cup N_1| \\ge 11+11-18 = 4.\\]\nTheir Conjecture 2.2 makes much stronger assumptions than the general double kissing problem and might therefore be more accessible. Note that in the animation of the 19-spheres configuration, there is not a single sphere that touches both central spheres. This is possible since the central spheres are not touched by 12 spheres each, but by 11 and 10 other spheres respectively (including the other central sphere)."

Due to the nature of TCC courses (being streamed to several universities) this was an online course taught via MS Teams.\n\nIntroduction\nPolytope Theory is the study of (convex) polytopes, the generalization of polygons (2D) and polyhedra (3D) to general dimension. Besides their geometric nature as convex sets, polytopes possess a rich combinatorial structure, making them exceptionally accessible by combinatorial techniques. The study of polytopes reaches from the antiquity (starting from the Platonic solids), over the 19th/20th century (understanding polytopes in 3D and initializing the study of polytopes in dimension \\(\\ge 3\\)), until today, where we understand that the richness of polytopal phenomena starts in dimension 4 and which led to findings such as universality. The subject has shown proximity to algebraic geometry, representation theory, analysis, optimization and many more.\n\n\nScope\nIn this course I aimed to give an overview of this very diverse subject and cover selected topics with focus towards research and open questions.

    "text": "Wachspress Geometry is a young subject in the intersection of geometry, combinatorics and algebra. It is at the core of my SPP 2458 project “Wachspress Coordinates – a bridge betwen Algebra, Geometry and Combinatorics”.\nWachspress Geometry is …\n\n… the study of the Wachspress objects, a somewhat mysterious family of constructions on convex polytopes. Those emerge in a wide range of seemingly unrelated contexts, and the goal is to explain and exploit these connections and to work towards a unifying explanation for the ubiquity of “Wachspress phenomena”.\n… among the best understood instances of Positive Geometry. The goal is to extend tools of Wachspress Geometry to more general positive geometries.\n\nPerhaps you have already come across some construction from Wachspress Geometry, whether in the shape of a canonical form, a stress in a framework, a model in algebraic statistics, cone volumes or volume differentials.\nBelow I will write an introduction to Wachspress Geometry, coming soon …\n\nIf you are interested, Rainer Sinn and I are organizing a workshop “Wachspress Geometry” in Leipzig on September 24th/25th 2024.\nmore coming soon …\n\nGeneralized barycentric coordinates\nPolytope skeleta as spectral embedding and the Izmestiev matrix\nCone volumes and variational definitions\nStresses in coned polytope frameworks + Maxwell-Cremona correspondence\nAdjoint polynomial and adjoint hypersurface + projective Geometry of Wachspress coordinated\nThe Wachspress map\nThe Wachspress variety\nThe Wachspress ideal\n\n\nGeneralized barycentric coordinates\nThere are several towards Wachspress Geometry. Here we present an approach via generalized barycentric coordinates. For all that comes we fix a convex polytope \\(P\\subset\\Bbb R^d\\) with vertices \\(p_1,...,p_n\\in\\Bbb R^d\\).\nEach point \\(x\\in P\\) can be expressed as a convex combination of the polytope’s vertice, that is,\n\\[x = \\sum_i \\alpha_i p_i,\\quad \\text{where $\\alpha_i\\ge 0$ and $\\alpha_1+\\dots+\\alpha_n=1$}.\\]\nIf \\(P\\) is a simplex then there is a unique choice for the coefficients \\(\\alpha\\in\\Bbb R^n\\), which are known as barycentric coordinates of \\(x\\).  If \\(P\\) is not a simplex, there is more than one way to choose the convex coefficients. For many applications it is however desirable to have a canonical choice across all points of \\(P\\), that is, a function \\(\\alpha:P\\to\\Delta_n\\) that satisfies linear precision:\n\\[\\sum_i \\alpha_i(x) p_i = x,\\quad\\text{for all $x\\in P$}.\\]\nHere \\(\\Delta_n:=\\{\\alpha\\in\\Bbb R^n_+\\mid \\alpha_1+\\cdots+\\alpha_n=1\\}\\) is the standard simplex or “space of convex coefficients”. Any such choice is called a system of generalized barycentric coordinates (or GBCs). Many such GBCs have been conceived for various application. One of them being the Wachspress coordinates.\n\n\nWachspress coordinates\nWachspress coordinates are a particular systems of generalized barcentric coordinates that exist for every convex polytope. Like many of the best constructions in mathematics, Wachspress coordinates have many equivalent definitions. In a sense, their true value for Wachspress Geometry lies in their many seemingly unrelated definitions that link them to a variety of subjects. We present some of them below.\n\n\nRational GBCs\nThe classical barycentric coordinates in simplices are linear functions in \\(x\\). The next best choice is perhaps a polynomial function. Eugene Wachspress showed that there are polytopes for which no polynomial GBCs exist. Instead he constructed a systems of rational GBCs that we now call Wachspress coordinates. He defined them initially on polygons in 2D, which was later generalized by Warren to general polytopes in higher dimensions.\nAs rational GBCs Wachspress coordinates are of the form\n\\[\\alpha_i(x) = \\frac{\\mathrm p_i(x)}{\\mathrm q(x)},\\quad \\text{where $\\mathrm q(x)=\\sum_i\\mathrm p_i(x)$}.\\]\nwith polynomials \\(\\mathrm p_i,\\mathrm q\\in\\Bbb R[X_1,...,X_d]\\).\nIf you want to construct them explicitly, you will quickly find that there is one natural way to do it:\n\\[\\mathrm p_i(x)=\\beta_i(x) \\prod_{F\\not\\ni i} H_F(x).\\]\nHere, the product runs over all facets \\(F\\) of \\(P\\) that are not incident to the vertex \\(i\\). \\(H_F\\) denotes the linear function that is zero on \\(\\operatorname{aff}(F)\\) and positive inside the polytope. The \\(\\beta_i\\) are necessary to ensure linear precision. This turns out to be the hard part: how to choose the \\(\\beta_i\\)? There is no easy answer, but one can compute them from facet volumes in the polar dual \\(P^\\circ\\). Most importantly however, the degree of \\(\\mathrm p_i\\) will eventually turn out precisely \\(\\text{\\#facets}-d\\).\n\nTheorem.  The Wachspress coordinates are the unique rational GBCs of lowest possible degree. In particular, \\(\\deg(\\mathrm p_i)=\\text{\\#facets}-d\\).\n\n\nAs rational GBCs\nThe usual barycentric coodinates on simplices are linear function. A natural choice for generalizations would then be polynomials. However, already Wachspress showed that polynomial GBCs do not exist for most polytopes.\nWachspress coordinates are the next best option: they are rational GBCs.\n\\[\\alpha_i(x) = \\frac{\\mathrm p_i(x)}{\\mathrm q(x)},\\quad \\text{where $\\mathrm q(x)=\\sum_i\\mathrm p_i(x)$}.\\]\n\nTheorem. (Warren, 19??)  Wachspress coordinates are the unique rational GBCs of lowest possible degree."

    "text": "The join is a well-known and rather general operation – it works on topological spaces, simplicial complexes, subsets of \\(\\Bbb R^n\\), polytopes and many others. I want to collect here some facts about joins that are perhaps not so well-known. This is also in preparation for an upcoming blog post on the non-symmetric Mahler conjecture. \\(\\DeclareMathOperator{\\vol}{vol}\\)\n\n\nThe join is an operation defined on objects as general as topological spaces. Given topological spaces \\(X\\), \\(Y\\), their join \\(X\\star Y\\) is defined as \\(X\\times [-1,1]\\times Y\\) quotiented by \\(x\\times\\{-1\\}\\times Y\\) for all \\(x\\in X\\) and \\(X\\times \\{1\\}\\times y\\) for all \\(y\\in Y\\).

Therefore, the join can also be defined as an operation on (face) lattices \\(\\mathcal P_i\\). In this form, some interesting properties are:\n\nthe join of simplices yields a simplex: \\(\\Delta_{d_1}\\star \\Delta_{d_2}\\simeq\\Delta_{d_1+d_2+1}\\) (combinatorially clear, just count the number of vertices).\nthe join commutes with duality: \\((\\mathcal P_1\\star \\mathcal P_2)^*\\simeq \\mathcal P_1^*\\star \\mathcal P_2^*\\), where \\(\\mathcal P^*\\) denotes combinatorial dual to the lattice \\(\\mathcal P\\) (i.e. turning it up side down).\n\nIt is now a good exercise to see whether these properties can be made work in the geometric setting as well. For example, if \\(0\\in P_i\\), can we have \\((P_1\\star P_2)^\\circ=P_1^\\circ\\star P_2^\\circ\\)? Can we have that the join of regular simplices is regular? How to compute the volume of \\(P_1\\star P_2\\)? These particular questions are inspired by their application to the non-symmetric Mahler conjecture in this blog article.\n\nIf the spaces are subsets \\(X_1\\subset\\Bbb R^{d_1}\\) and \\(X_2\\subset\\Bbb R^{d_2}\\), then the join \\(X_1\\star X_2\\) can be realized as a subset of \\(\\Bbb R^{d_1}\\times\\Bbb R\\times\\Bbb R^{d_2}\\cong\\Bbb R^{D}\\) (where \\(D=d_1+d_2+1\\)): embed \\(X_1\\) and \\(X_2\\) into \\(\\Bbb R^D\\) so that their affine spans are disjoint, and then mapping \\((a,t,b)\\) to \\((1-t)a+tb\\).\nLet’s be more precise. We fix disjoint subspaces \\(H_1,H_2\\subset \\Bbb R^{D}\\) of dimension \\(d_1,d_2\\) respectively, as well as isomorphisms \\(\\phi_i:\\Bbb R^{d_i}\\xrightarrow{\\sim} H_i\\).\n\nThe faces of \\(P_1\\star P_2\\) are of the form \\(\\sigma_1\\star \\sigma_2\\), where \\(\\sigma_i\\in\\mathcal F(P_i)\\). Hence, the f-vector of the join is\n\\[f_k(P_1\\star P_2)= \\sum_{i+j=k} f_i(P_1)f_j(P_2).\\]\nIn particular, the faces can be indexed by pairs \\((\\sigma_1,\\sigma_2)\\) and the face lattice structure can be recovered via\n\\[(\\sigma_1,\\sigma_2)\\preceq (\\tau_1,\\tau_2) \\;:\\Longleftarrow\\; \\sigma_1\\preceq \\tau_1\\,\\land\\,\\sigma_2\\preceq\\tau_2.\\]\nIn fact, the face lattice of the join is merely the product of the individual face lattices (in the sense of the usual product order). From this it is easy to see that\n\\[\\big(\\mathcal F(P_1)\\star \\mathcal F(P_2)\\big)^{\\mathrm{op}} \\simeq \\mathcal F(P_1)^{\\mathrm{op}}\\star\\mathcal F(P_2)^{\\mathrm{op}}.\\]\n\nLet’s fix parameter \\(x_1,x_2,c_1,c_2\\in\\Bbb R\\). For convex sets \\(B_1\\subset\\Bbb R^{d_1}\\) and \\(B_2\\subset\\Bbb R^{d_2}\\) we write \\(B_1 \\star B_2 \\subset \\Bbb R^{d_1}\\times\\Bbb R^{d_2}\\times\\Bbb R\\cong \\Bbb R^{d_1+d_2+1}\\) for the result of the following construction:\n\nconsider \\(\\Bbb R^{d_1+d_2+1}=\\operatorname{span}\\{e_0;e_1^1,...,e_{d_1}^1;e_1^2,...,e_{d_2}^2\\}\\) and define the following affine subspaces:  \\[\nH_i=x_i e_0 + \\operatorname{span}\\{e_{1}^i,...,e_{d_2}^i\\}.\n\\]\nembed \\(c_i B_i\\) into \\(H_i\\) with the origin mapped to \\(x_i e_0\\).\nthe convex hull of both embedded sets is the result of the operation.\n\nThe other direction requires some preparation. Let \\(B_1\\star B_2 \\subset\\Bbb R^{2d+1}\\) denote the join of convex bodies \\(B_1,B_2\\subset\\Bbb R^d\\). For our purpose we need that the join is constructed geometrically as follows: first we embed the \\(B_i\\) into two specific \\(d\\)-dimensional affine subspaces of \\(\\Bbb R^{2d+1}\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nH_1 &= -e_0 + \\operatorname{span}\\{e_1,...,e_d\\},\n\\\\\nH_2 &= \\phantom+ e_0 + \\operatorname{span}\\{e_{d+1},...,e_{2d}\\},\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nso that the origin in \\(B_i\\) is mapped to \\(\\pm e_0\\) respectively. The join \\(B_1\\star B_2\\) is then the convex hull of the embedded sets.\nWe make three obsevations.\n(1) Volume\nThe volume of \\(B_1\\star B_2\\) can be computed as as follows: the section of \\(B_1\\star B_2\\) with the hyperplane \\(e_0^\\bot + se_0, s\\in[-1,1]\\) is of the form \\(t B_1\\times (1-t) B_2\\) with \\(t=\\frac12(s+1)\\in[0,1]\\). Thus\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\vol(B_1\\star B_2)\n    &= \\phantom 2\\!\\int_{-1}^1 \\!\\!\\vol\\big((B_1\\star B_2) \\cap (e_0^\\bot+ s e_0)\\big) \\,\\mathrm ds\n\\\\ &= 2\\! \\int_0^1 \\!\\!\\vol(t B_1\\times (1-t) B_2) \\,\\mathrm dt\n\\\\ &= \\vol(B_1)\\cdot \\vol(B_2) \\cdot \\underbrace{2\\!\\int_0^1 \\!\\!t(1-t) \\,\\mathrm dt}_{=: c}.\n    = c\\cdot \\vol(B_1)\\cdot\\vol(B_2).\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n(2) Polarity\nThe specific gemetric realization of the join chosen here commutes with polarity: \\[(B_1\\star B_2)^\\circ=B_1^\\circ\\star B_2^\\circ.\\] In particular, \\(B\\star B^\\circ\\) is self-polar!\n(2) Simplices\nSimplices are closed under the join operation. If \\(\\Delta_d\\) denotes a \\(d\\)-dimensional simplex, then\n\\[\\Delta_d\\star\\Delta_e \\simeq \\Delta_{d+e+1}.\\]\n\n\\(s=(1-t)a+tb = a + (b-a)t\\).\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\vol(A\\star B)\n    &= \\int_a^b \\!\\vol\\!\\big((A\\star B)\\cap H_s\\big) \\,\\mathrm ds\n  \\\\&= (b-a)\\cdot \\int_0^1 \\!\\vol\\!\\big((1-t)\\alpha A+t \\beta B\\big) \\,\\mathrm dt\n  \\rlap{\\quad \\text{\\small\\color{lightgray} (using $\\tfrac{\\mathrm ds}{\\mathrm dt}=b-a$)}}\n  \\\\&= (b-a) \\cdot\\alpha^{d_A}\\beta^{d_B} \\cdot\\vol(A)\\cdot\\vol(B)\\cdot \\int_0^1 (1-t)^{d_A}t^{d_B} \\,\\mathrm dt\n  \\\\&= \\underbrace{\\alpha^{d_A}\\beta^{d_B}\\cdot(b-a)\\cdot\\frac{(d_A+1)!(d_B+1)!}{(d_A+d_B+1)!}}_{=:\\,K(a,b;\\alpha,\\beta;d_A,d_B)} \\cdot\\vol(A)\\cdot\\vol(B).\n\\end{align}\n\\]"

    "text": "The Mahler conjecture asserts that among all centrally symmetric convex bodies \\(B\\) the cube minimizes the volume product \\(\\operatorname{vol}(B)\\operatorname{vol}(B^\\circ)\\). While famously open, several proofs have been discovered for the special case of coordinate symmetric bodies. I want to share here a surprisingly short and elegant proof by Mathieu Meyer that seems otherwise unavailable in the English litrature. \\(\\DeclareMathOperator{\\vol}{vol}\\)\n\n\nLet \\(B\\subset\\Bbb R^n\\) be a centrally symmetric convex body, where we shall assume \\(-B=B\\). Kurt Mahler defined the following linearly invariant notion of volume now known as Mahler volume:\n\\[\nM(B):=\\operatorname{vol}(B)\\operatorname{vol}(B^\\circ).\n\\]\nHere \\(B^\\circ:=\\{y\\in\\Bbb R^n\\mid \\langle x,y\\rangle\\le 1\\text{ for all }x\\in B\\}\\) denotes the polar dual of \\(B\\). It has long been known that the Mahler volume attains a maximum for the sphere. There are also clear ideas for what should minimize the Mahler volume: the cube, and more generally, each of the Hanner polytopes. But a proof remains elusive. This is the infamous Mahler conjecture, which remains open to this day:\n\nMahler conjecture.  For each centrally symmetric convex body \\(B\\subset\\Bbb R^n\\) holds \\[M(B)\\ge M(\\text{$n$-cube}) = \\smash{\\frac{4^n}{n!}}.\\]\n\nBelow I share a very elegant and somewhat mysterious proof for the special case of coordinate symmetric bodies that, I believe, is not available in the English literature elsewhere. For some general background on the Mahler conjecture as well as its status, check out the Wikipedia article and Terry Tao’s blog entry on the topic.\n\nCoordinate symmetric bodies and convex corners\nA convex body \\(B\\subset\\Bbb R^n\\) is coordinate symmetric if it is invariant under reflection on each coordinate hyperplane \\(H_i:=\\{x_i=0\\}\\). A number of properties make coordinate symmetric bodies a natural special case for studying the Mahler conjecture: they are centrally symmetric, closed under polarity, and they contain all Hanner polytopes.  \n\nIn the literature these bodies are often called “unconditional bodies”, a term going back to “unconditional convergence” motivated from Banach space theory. For geometric (that is, finite-dimensional) discussions I prefer to go with the more visually inspired term “coordinate symmetric”.\nA coordinate symmetric body \\(B\\) is clearly determined by its restriction \\(B_+:=B\\cap\\Bbb R^n_+\\) to the positive orthant \\(\\Bbb R_+^n:=\\{x_i\\ge 0\\}\\). A set \\(B_+\\subset\\Bbb R^n_+\\) that can be written as such a restriction of a coordinate symmetric body is called a convex corner (also known as an anti-blocking body).\n\nConvex corners are in one-to-one correspondence with coordinate symmetric bodies. We prove the Mahler conjecture for coordinate symmetric bodies by formulating and proving a version on convex corners. For this we require a notion of polar duality that works for convex corners. If \\(B_+:= B\\cap\\Bbb R^n_+\\) then\n\\[B_+^* := \\{x\\in\\Bbb R^n_+\\mid \\langle x,y\\rangle\\le 1 \\text{ for all } y\\in B_+\\} = B^\\circ\\cap\\Bbb R^n_+.\\]\nSince a coordinate symmetric body consists of \\(2^n\\) identical copies of its convex corner and hence \\(\\vol(B)=2^n\\vol(B_+)\\), it is sufficient to prove the following:\n\nTheorem.  For each convex corner \\(B_+\\subset\\Bbb R^n_+\\) holds \\[M_+(B_+):=\\operatorname{vol}(B_+)\\operatorname{vol}(B_+^*) \\ge \\smash{\\frac1{n!}}.\\]\n\n\n\nProving the Mahler conjecture for convex corners\nThe following very short and elegant proof is due to Mathieu Meyer from his 1986 article Une caractérisation volumique de certains espaces normés. It was brought to my attention by Raman Sanyal, whose presentation of the proof I follow below.\nLet \\(B_i:=B_+\\cap\\{x_i=0\\}\\) and \\(B_i^*:=B_+^*\\cap \\{x_i=0\\}\\), and observe that those are themselves convex corners of dimension \\(n-1\\), and are duals of each other in the sense defined above. Define vectors \\(v,v^*\\in\\Bbb R^n\\) with components\n\\[v_i := \\frac{\\operatorname{vol}_{n-1}(B_i)}{n \\operatorname{vol}_{n}(B_+)},\\quad\\; v_i^* := \\frac{\\operatorname{vol}_{n-1}(B_i^*)}{n \\operatorname{vol}_{n}(B_+^*)}\\]\n(where from now on we put dimension subscripts on the volumes to avoid confusion). For a point \\(x\\in \\Bbb R_+^n\\) the inner product \\(\\langle x,v\\rangle\\) evaluates to\n\\[\n\\langle x,v\\rangle\n= \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\\frac{\\operatorname{vol}_{n-1}(B_i)}{n \\operatorname{vol}_n(B_+)}\n= \\frac1{\\operatorname{vol}_{n}(B_+)} \\cdot \\sum_{i=1}^n \\underbrace{\\tfrac1n{x_i \\operatorname{vol}_{n-1}(B_i)}}_{\\operatorname{vol}_n(C_i)},\n\\]\nwhere \\(C_i\\) is the cone with base face \\(B_i\\) and apex at \\(x\\).\n\nIf \\(x\\in B_+\\) then the cones \\(C_i\\) have disjoint interiors and are contained in \\(B_+\\). In particular, the sum of their volumes is bounded by \\(\\operatorname{vol}_n(B_+)\\). Therefore \\(\\langle x,v\\rangle \\le 1\\) for all \\(x\\in B_+\\), and hence \\(v\\in B_+^*\\). By an analogous argument holds \\(v^*\\in B_+\\). Hence, we can conclude\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n1\\,\\ge\\, &\\langle v,v^*\\rangle\n=  \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{\\operatorname{vol}_{n-1}(B_i)\\operatorname{vol}_{n-1}(B_i^*)}{n^2\\operatorname{vol}_n(B_+)\\operatorname{vol}_n(B_+^*)}\n= \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{M_+(B_i)}{n^2M_+(B_+)}.\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nBy rearranging and applying the induction hypothesis \\(M_+(B_i)\\ge 1/(n-1)!\\) we obtain\n\\[\nM_+(B_+) \\ge \\frac1{n^2} \\sum_{i=1}^n M_+(B_i) \\ge \\frac1{n^2} \\cdot\\frac{n}{(n-1)!} = \\frac1{n!}.\n\\]\nFrom this proof one can also extract the minimizers. Those turn out to be precisely the Hanner corners (that is, the positive corners of Hanner polytopes). Consequently, the minimizers among the coordinate symmetric bodies are indeed the Hanner polytopes.\n\n\nIt’s not about central symmetry anymore\nCoordinate symmetric bodies might seem a bit … restrictive. After all, they require quite some symmetry. However, as it turns out, once the problem is solved for convex corners, there is no longer any need to piece them together into a coordinate symmetric body to satisfy the Mahler conjecture. Even wilder, we don’t even need central symmetry anymore!\nA locally anti-blocking body is a convex body that if restricted to any orthant yields a convex corner (this is the official term, I don’t yet have a good idea for a more visually descriptive name).\n\nLocally anti-blocking bodies are a much richer family of bodie as compared to the highly symmetric coordinate symmetric bodies. In fact, they need not even be centrally symmetric! Still, they are closed under polar duality and share a number of nice properties with coordinate symmetric bodies.\nThe Mahler conjecture for locally anti-blocking bodies can be proven using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. For \\(\\sigma\\in\\{-1,+1\\}^n\\) write \\(\\Bbb R^n_\\sigma:=\\{x\\in\\Bbb R^n\\mid \\sigma_i x_i\\ge 0\\}\\). For a locally anti-blocking body \\(B\\) define\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nw_\\sigma&:=\\operatorname{vol}( B\\cap \\Bbb R^n_\\sigma),\\quad\nw_\\sigma^*:=\\operatorname{vol}( B^\\circ\\cap \\Bbb R^n_\\sigma)\n\\end{align},\n\\]\nwhich are precisely the volumes of its \\(2^n\\) convex corners. Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality (CS) and the proof for convex corners \\((*)\\), we conclude\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nM(B)\n= \\operatorname{vol}(B)\\operatorname{vol}(B^\\circ)\n&=\\Big(\\sum_\\sigma w_\\sigma\\Big)\\Big(\\sum_\\sigma w_\\sigma^*\\Big)\n\\\\&\\!\\overset{\\text{(CS)}}\\ge \\Big(\\sum_\\sigma \\sqrt{w_\\sigma w_\\sigma^*}\\Big)^{\\kern-1pt 2}\n\\overset{(*)}\\ge \\Big(\\frac{2^n}{\\sqrt{n!}}\\Big)^{\\kern-1pt 2} = \\frac{4^n}{n!}.\n\\end{align}\n\\]"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Each \\(2\\)-dimensional CW complex can be embedded into 5-dimensional Euclidean space, but not necessarily into 4-dimensional space. In general, the problem of whether a given 2-complex embeds into \\(\\Bbb R^4\\) is believed to be very hard, potentially even undecidable. Still, I really really want to know whether my favorite 2-complexes embed!\n\nA 2-dimensional CW complex \\(\\mathcal X\\) is built from a topological graph (its 1-skeleton) together with 2-dimensional discs (its 2-cells) whose bondaries we glue to the graph along closed walks. Every 2-dimensional complex can be triangulated, so you lose nothing by thinking of simplicial complexes instead. Still, the constructions below go through easier if we allow for the flexibility of CW complexes. An embedding of \\(\\mathcal X\\) in 4-space is an injective map \\(\\mathcal X\\to\\Bbb R^4\\). You might assume a piecewise linear map to avoid thinking about topological pathologies.\nI will get to the heart of the matter right away, and deliver some background later on.\n\nBefore I tell you what I don’t know, let’s get accquainted with the task by looking at some standard examples. The complete 2-dimensional (simplicial) complex \\(\\mathcal K_n^2\\) is built from the complete graph \\(K_n\\) by attaching a 2-cell along each triangle (this is indeed a simplicial complex).\n\n\\(\\mathcal K_6^2\\) embeds in 4-space. Here is a quick construction using polytopes: \\(\\mathcal K_6^2\\) is the 2-skeleton of the 5-dimensional simplex \\(\\Delta_5\\). A Schlegel diagram of \\(\\Delta_5\\) is embedded in 4-space and contains an embedding of \\(\\mathcal K_6^2\\).\n\\(\\mathcal K_7^2\\) does not embed in 4-space. This is shown using the van Kampen obstuction (see below). Removing a single 2-simplex from \\(\\mathcal K_7^2\\) makes it embeddable. A nice argument for this was shown to me by Tâm Nguyên-Phan. I summarize it here.\n\n\nNow, let’s turn to some complexes for which the question of embeddability seems unanswered.\n\nThe join complex \\(\\mathcal J_{3,n}\\)\nStart by constructing the join of the complete graphs \\(K_3\\) and \\(K_n\\). This means add all possible edges between them. This yields \\(K_3\\sqcup K_{3,n}\\sqcup K_n\\simeq K_{n+3}\\). This will serve as the 1-skeleton of \\(\\mathcal J_{3,n}\\). Now we add the following 2-cells: for any four vertices \\(a,b\\in K_3\\) and \\(c,d\\in K_n\\) add the 2-cell along \\(abcd\\).\n\nI already know that \\(\\mathcal J_{3,4}\\) can be embedded in 4-space. An embedding is constructed from the embedding of \\(\\mathcal K_7^2\\) minus a 2-cell by a sequence of operations that preserve embeddability. If you are interested in details, let me refer you to my article with Agelos Georgakopoulos On 2-complexes embeddable in 4-space, and the excluded minors of their underlying graphs.\nThe first interesting case is \\(\\mathcal J_{3,5}\\), for which I don’t know the answer. Personally, I would like it to be not embeddable, but I really don’t know. The same holds for any \\(\\mathcal J_{3,n},n\\ge 5\\).\nHere are some modifications that do not diminish my interest in these complexes:\n\nfor \\(a,b\\in K_3\\) and \\(c,d\\in K_n\\) add further 2-cells along \\(abdc\\), \\(acbd\\) and \\(adbc\\).\nadd a 2-cell along the triangle in \\(K_3\\subset\\mathcal J_{3,n}\\).\nadd a cone over \\(K_n\\subset\\mathcal J_{3,n}\\). This means that we add a new vertex \\(x\\), add edges connecting it to all vertices of \\(K_n\\), and fill in all triangles that pass through \\(x\\) with 2-cells.\n\nI asked about this on MathOverflow without much success.\n\n\nThe long cycle complex \\(\\mathcal H_{2n-1}\\)\nThis is a short one.\nConstruct \\(\\mathcal H_{2n-1}\\) from the complete graph \\(K_{2n-1}\\) by attaching a 2-cell along each cycles of length \\(n\\) (alternatively, along each cycle of length at least \\(n\\)).\n\n\nSome background\nThe van Kampen obstruction is a standard technique to certify that a given 2-complex cannot be embedded into \\(\\Bbb R^4\\): you compute a number from \\(\\mathcal X\\) using a mechanical procedure, and if this number is non-zero, then you know that \\(\\mathcal X\\) cannot be embedded. However, if the computation yields zero (we say, the obstruction vanishes), you don’t learn anything about embeddability. We say, the van Kampen obstruction is incomplete. The mean fact on top: there exists an analogous obstruction for the embedding problem \\(n\\to2n\\) for each \\(n\\ge 1\\), and the obstruction fails to be complete only for \\(2\\to 4\\).\nThe standard example that shows that the van Kampen obstruction is incomplete is the Freedman-Krushkal-Teichner complex (or FKT complex for short). It has vanishing van Kampen obstruction, but does not embed in \\(\\Bbb R^4\\).\nI will not recall the van Kampen obstruction or the FKT complex. I do however want to mention that the FKT complex, while not super complicated in its construction, is not super simple either. I believe that the join complex or long cycle complex, if non-embeddable, have a chance to replace the FKT complex as the simplest known example for the van Kampen obstruction’s incompleteness.\nWhy does th van Kampen obstruction vanish for the above complexes? Even thought I wont recall the definition of the obstruction, I can give an intuition for why it vanishes. For computing the van Kampen onstruction one starts by enumerating all disjoint 2-cell pairs of \\(\\mathcal X\\), that is, all pairs \\((c_1,c_2)\\), where \\(c_1,c_2\\subseteq \\mathcal X\\) are 2-cells with \\(c_1\\cap c_2=\\varnothing\\). The computation then goes on working with this list, but we don’t need to know the details. Observe however that in all candidate complexes constructed above any two 2-cells intersect. That is, there are no disjoint 2-cell pairs. As a consequnce, the computation operates on an empty list, which results in the van Kampen obstruction being zero.\nLet me give yet another reasone for why the embeddability of the join complex in particular is of relevantce to me. Given a complex \\(\\mathcal X_\\Delta\\) containing a triangle \\(\\Delta\\) in its 1-skeleton with vertices, say, \\(x_1,x_2,x_3\\). Performing a \\(\\Delta\\mathrm Y\\)-transformations on \\(\\Delta\\) turns the complex into a new complex \\(\\mathcal X_{\\mathrm Y}\\) via the following steps:\n\ndelete the edges \\(x_1x_2\\), \\(x_2x_3\\) and \\(x_3x_1\\) of \\(\\Delta\\),\nadd a new vertex \\(y\\) as well as edges \\(yx_1\\), \\(yx_2\\) and \\(yx_3\\),\nreroute each 2-cell formerly attached along \\(x_i x_j\\) to now run along \\(x_i y x_j\\) instead.\n\nIn our article “On 2-complexes embeddable in 4-space, and the excluded minors of their underlying graphs”, Agelos Georgakopoulos and me posed the following conjecture:\n\nConjecture 3.14.  Suppose that the complex \\(\\mathcal X_\\Delta\\) is embeddable. Then the following are equivalent:\n\n\n\\(\\mathcal X_{\\mathrm Y}\\) is embeddable.\n\n\n\\(\\mathcal X_\\Delta\\) with a 2-cell attached along \\(\\Delta\\) is embeddable.\n\n\n\nWe proved the direction ii. \\(\\Longrightarrow\\) i., but the other direction remains open. If the join complex turns out embeddable, we can “improve it” it by adding a 2-cell along its triangle \\(K_3\\subset\\mathcal J_{3,n}\\). If this makes a difference for its embeddability, this would constitute a counterexample to the above conjecture."

    "text": "There are two natural ways to define a convex polytope:\n\nas the convex hull of finitely many points (a V-polytope), and\nas the bounded intersection of finitely many half-spaces (an H-polytope).\n\nIt seems obvious that these describe the exact same class of objects. Though actually proving this then turns out less trivial than expected. For example, Günter Ziegler in his book “Lectures on Polytopes” goes the algorithmic rout via Fourier-Motzkin elimination. I always found this an overkill if one just wants to know that it is true. Below I present the shortest, most elementary and most direct proof that I was able to come up with.  It is short, but not super short. If you can think of a shorter or more direct proof, let me know. Also, let me know if there are gaps or parts that are actually more intricate than they seem.\n\nTheorem  V-polytopes \\(\\,=\\,\\) H-polytopes.\n\nProof\n\\(\\Longrightarrow\\):\nLet \\(P\\) be an H-polytope given as the bounded intersection of half-spaces \\(H_1,..., H_m\\). We want to find finitely many points \\(p_1,...,p_n\\) so that \\(P=\\operatorname{conv}(p_1,...,p_n)\\). We proceed by induction on the dimension \\(d\\) of the ambient space. The statement is clearly true for polytopes in \\(\\Bbb R\\) (aka. line segments). Let us therefore assume that \\(P\\subset\\Bbb R^d\\) for some \\(d\\ge 2\\).\nLet \\(\\partial H_i\\) denote the boundary hyperplane of \\(H_i\\).  Easy enough, the intersection \\(P_i:=P\\cap\\partial H_i\\) is an H-polytope in a lower-dimensional space. By induction hypothesis \\(P_i=\\operatorname{conv}(V_i)\\) for some finite point set \\(V_i\\subset\\Bbb R^d\\). We define \\(V=\\bigcup_i V_i\\), which is finite, and claim \\(P=\\operatorname{conv}(V)\\).\nOne direction is immediate: since \\(V\\subset P\\) we have \\(\\operatorname{conv}(V)\\subseteq \\operatorname{conv}(P)=P\\).\nFor the other direction fix a point \\(x\\in P\\). Consider some line \\(R:=\\{x+tv\\mid t\\in\\Bbb R\\}\\). Since \\(P\\) is convex and bounded, \\(R\\cap P\\) is a finite length line segment with end points \\(y_1,y_2\\). Easy enough, some of the halfspaces, say \\(H_1\\) and \\(H_2\\), satisfy \\(y_i\\in \\partial H_i\\), and hence, \\(y_i\\in P_i=\\operatorname{conv}(V_i)\\). We conclude \\(y_1,y_2\\in \\operatorname{conv}(V_1\\cup V_2)\\), and eventually\n\\[\nx\n\\in\\operatorname{conv}\\{y_1,y_2\\}\n\\subseteq\\operatorname{conv}(V_1\\cup V_2)\n\\subseteq\\operatorname{conv}(V).\n\\]\n\\(\\Longleftarrow\\):\n\nThis direction is especially easy if we assume some knowledge of polar duals: given a V-polytope \\(P=\\operatorname{conv}\\{p_1,..,p_n\\}\\), its polar dual is\n\\[P^\\circ:=\\big\\{x\\in\\Bbb R^d\\mid \\langle x,p_i\\rangle\\le 1\\text{ for all $i\\in\\{1,...,n\\}$}\\big\\}.\\]\nSuppose that \\(0\\in\\operatorname{int}(P)\\) (otherwise translate and restrict to the affine span). Some general properties of the polar map in this case are\n\n\\((P^\\circ)^\\circ=P\\)\n\\(P^\\circ\\) is bounded\n\\(P^\\circ\\) is contains the origin in its relative interior.\n\nWe already see that \\(P^\\circ\\) is an H-polytope defined by the half-spaces \\(H_i:=\\{\\langle x, p_i\\rangle \\le 1\\}\\).

    "section": "",
    "text": "Today I hosted Anna Zamojska-Dzienio from the Warsaw University of Technology. She introduced me to barycentric algebras. Among other things, they allow us to see polytopes and face lattices as the same sort of object !  Intuitively, barycentric algebras are spaces in which one can take the convex combination of elements. I give here my own presentation of what she taught me. Since all of this is new to me there might be errors. Those are mine, not Anna’s.\n\nA barycentric algebra \\(\\mathcal B\\) is an algebra in the sense of “abstract algebra”, consisting of a ground set \\(B\\), and for each real number \\(r\\in(0,1)\\) a binary operation \\(\\underline{r}:B\\times B\\to B\\), subject to the following three axioms:\n\nidempotence : \\(\\;\\underline{r}(a,a)=a\\),\nskew-symmetry : \\(\\;\\underline{r}(a,b)=\\underline{r}^*(b,a)\\), where \\(r^*:=1-r\\),\nskew-associativity : using \\(r\\circ s:=(r^*s^*)^*=r+s-rs\\) it holds \\[r\\big(s(a,b),c\\big) = \\underline{\\smash{r\\circ s}}\\big(a,\\underline{\\tfrac{r}{r\\circ s}}(b,c)\\big).\\]\n\n\nThe two most instructive examples for barycentric algebras also represent the two extreme cases:\nConvex sets. A convex set \\(K\\subseteq\\Bbb R^n\\) can be identified as a barycentric algebra by setting\n\\[\\underline{r}(a,b):=(1-r)a+rb.\\]\nIn particular, polytopes are barycentric algebras. In some sense, polytopes are the finitely generated barycentric algebras (more details below).\nSemi-lattices. A (join) semi-lattice \\(\\mathcal L\\) with a join operation \\(\\vee\\) is a barycentric algebra under the operation\n\\[\\underline{r}(a,b):=a\\vee b.\\]\nIn particular, the face lattice \\(\\mathcal F(P)\\) of a polytope \\(P\\) is a barycentric algebra.\n\nA barycentric algebra homomorphism is a map \\(\\phi:\\mathcal A\\to\\mathcal B\\) with\n\\[\\phi\\big(\\underline{r}(a,b)\\big)= \\underline{r}\\big(\\phi(a),\\phi(b)\\big).\\]\n\nThe relation between polytopes and their face lattices is the following: the map \\(P\\to\\mathcal F(P)\\) that sends a point \\(x\\in P\\) to the unique face \\(\\sigma\\in\\mathcal F(P)\\) that contains \\(x\\) as an interior point, is a (barycentric algebra) homomorphism. And it is a distinguished homomorphism, as we will see shortly.\nThe relevant property that separates barycentric algebras of convex sets from the ones definde on semi-lattices turns out to be cancellativity:\n\\[\\underline{r}(a,b)=\\underline{r}(a,c) \\;\\implies\\; b=c.\\]\nConvex sets are cancellative; whereas semi-lattices are “the most non-cancellative” in the sense that they don’t have any non-trivial cancellative sub-algebras. Cancellativity is also a main reason for why we use \\(r\\in(0,1)\\) as opposed to \\(r\\in[0,1]\\): otherwise no barycentric algebra would be cancellative.\nBased on this, barycentric algebras are divided into three types:\n\ngeometric type are the cencellative barycentric algebras. They are intended to abstract convex sets.\ncombinatorial type have no non-trivial cancellative sub-algebras (in particular, are non-cancellative themselves). They are precisely the semi-lattices.\nmixed type fall into neither of the above classes.\n\nAn example of a mixed type is \\(\\Bbb R\\cup\\{\\infty\\}\\) with \\(\\underline{r}(x,\\infty)=\\infty\\) and normal convex combination on all other elements.\nThere exists a satisfying structure theory for barycentric algebras that separates the geometry from the combinatorics: each barycentric algebra can be subdivided into cancellative sub-algebras (the geometric parts), that when “contracted” leave a semi-lattice (the combinatorial part).\n\nTheorem   For a barycentric algebra \\(\\mathcal B\\) exists a unique homomorphism \\(\\phi:\\mathcal B\\to\\mathcal L\\) onto a semi-lattice \\(\\mathcal L\\) so that all preimages of elements \\(\\sigma\\in\\mathcal L\\) are cancellative. \n\nFor polytopes this distinguished semi-lattice is precisely the face-lattice (minus the empty face).\nThis provides us with an “abstract algebra” definition of face-lattice! A simplex is a finitely-generated free barycentric algebra; a polytope is a homomorphic cancellative image of a simplex (analogous to how polytopes are projections of simplices); and a face-lattice is a maximal “totally non-cancellative” image of a polytope."
