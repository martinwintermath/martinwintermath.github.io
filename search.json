Due to the nature of TCC courses (being streamed to several universities) this was an online course taught via MS Teams.\n\nIntroduction\nPolytope Theory is the study of (convex) polytopes, the generalization of polygons (2D) and polyhedra (3D) to general dimension. Besides their geometric nature as convex sets, polytopes possess a rich combinatorial structure, making them exceptionally accessible by combinatorial techniques. The study of polytopes reaches from the antiquity (starting from the Platonic solids), over the 19th/20th century (understanding polytopes in 3D and initializing the study of polytopes in dimension \\(\\ge 3\\)), until today, where we understand that the richness of polytopal phenomena starts in dimension 4 and which led to findings such as universality. The subject has shown proximity to algebraic geometry, representation theory, analysis, optimization and many more.\n\n\nScope\nIn this course I aimed to give an overview of this very diverse subject and cover selected topics with focus towards research and open questions.

    "text": "The Mahler conjecture asserts that among all centrally symmetric convex bodies \\(B\\) of the cube minimizes the volume product \\(\\operatorname{vol}(B)\\cdot\\operatorname{vol}(B^\\circ)\\). As of today, this is an open problem. A short elegant proof was given for unconditional convex bodies, which seems however hard to track down in the literature. The proof was shown to me by Raman Sanyal, and I want to share it with you in this blog post.\n\n\nMahler volume and Mahler conjecture\nGiven a centrally symmetric convex body \\(B\\subset\\Bbb R^n\\) (which we shall assume means \\(-B=B\\)), Mahler defined the following linearly invariant “notion of volume” – the Mahler volume:\n\\[\nM(B):=\\operatorname{vol}(B)\\cdot\\operatorname{vol}(B^\\circ),\n\\]\nwhere \\(B^\\circ:=\\{y\\in\\Bbb R^n\\mid \\langle x,y\\rangle\\le 1\\text{ for all }x\\in B\\}\\) denotes the polar dual of \\(B\\). He then conjectured that\n\\[M(P)\\ge M(\\text{$d$-cube}) = \\frac{4^d}{d!}.\\]\nThis is known as the Mahler conjecture. This problem is excruciatingly hard, and a lot of things have been written on it. Here you can find a blog article by Terry Tao.\n\n\nUnconditional bodies and unconditional corners\nHere I simply want to include a very beautiful and very magic proof of the Mahler conjecture for so-called coordinate-symmetric (or unconditional) polytopes.\nA convex body \\(B\\subset\\Bbb R^n\\) is coordinate-symmetric if it is invariant under reflection on every coordinate hyperplane \\(H_i:=\\{x_i=0\\}\\).  This class of convex bodies is in the literature better known as unconditional bodies. I am unsure about the origin of this term, and I tend to dislike it since it is seems the opposite of self-explanatory.\nA coordinate-symmetric corner is the restriction of a coordinate symmetric body to the positive orthant \\(\\Bbb R_+:=\\{(x_1,...,x_n)\\in\\Bbb R^n\\mid x_i\\ge 0\\}\\). Since every coordinate-symmetric body consists of \\(2^n\\) coordinate-symmetric corners, one can proof their Mahler conjecture by proving the following:\nThe statement of the Mahler conjecture for antiblocking polytopes reduces to\n\\[M_+(P_+):=\\operatorname{vol}(P_+)\\cdot\\operatorname{vol}(P_+^*) \\ge 1/d!\\]\n\n\nThe Mahler Conjecture for unconditional bodies\nThe followin very short and elegant proof is due to … . It was shown to me by Raman Sanyal.\nLet \\(P_i:=P_+\\cap\\{x_i=0\\}\\) and \\(P_i^*:=P_+^*\\cap \\{x_i=0\\}\\), which are antiblocking. Define vectors \\(v,v^*\\in\\Bbb R^d\\) by\n\\[ v_i := \\frac{\\operatorname{vol}_{d-1}(P_i)}{d \\operatorname{vol}_{d}(P_+)},\\quad\\; v_i^* := \\frac{\\operatorname{vol}_{d-1}(P_i^*)}{d \\operatorname{vol}_{d}(P_+^*)}\\]\nFor a point \\(x\\in \\Bbb R_+^d\\) the inner product \\(\\langle x,v\\rangle\\) evaluates to\n\\[\n\\langle x,v\\rangle\n= \\sum_{i=1}^d x_i\\frac{\\operatorname{vol}_{d-1}(P_i)}{d \\operatorname{vol}_d(P_+)}\n= \\frac1{\\operatorname{vol}_{d}(P_+)} \\cdot \\sum_{i=1}^d \\underbrace{\\tfrac1d{x_i \\operatorname{vol}_{d-1}(P_i)}}_{\\operatorname{vol}_d(C_i)},\n\\]\nwhere \\(C_i\\) is the cone with base face \\(P_i\\) and cone point \\(x\\). If \\(x\\in P_+\\) then the cones \\(C_i\\) have disjoint interiors and are contained in \\(P_+\\). In particular, the sum of their volumes is bounded by \\(\\operatorname{vol}_d(P_+)\\). Therefore \\(\\langle x,v\\rangle \\le 1\\) for all \\(x\\in P_+\\), and hence \\(v\\in P_+^*\\). By an analogous argument holds \\(v^*\\in P_+\\). In particular,\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n1\\ge &\\langle v,v^*\\rangle\n=  \\sum_{i=1}^d \\frac{\\operatorname{vol}_{d-1}(P_i)\\operatorname{vol}_{d-1}(P_i^*)}{d^2\\operatorname{vol}_d(P_+)\\operatorname{vol}_d(P_+^*)}\n= \\sum_{i=1}^d \\frac{M_+(P_i)}{d^2M_+(P_+)}.\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nBy rearranging and applying the induction hypothesis \\(M_+(P_i)\\ge 1/(d-1)!\\) we conclude\n\\[\nM_+(P_+) \\ge \\frac1{d^2} \\sum_{i=1}^d M_+(P_i) \\ge \\frac1{d^2} \\cdot\\frac{d}{(d-1)!} = \\frac1{d!}.\n\\]\nThis prove was first shown to me by Raman Sanyal. But it goes back to [1]. An earlier but much more involved proof can be found in [1].\nFrom this proof one can also extract the minimizers. We do not include this here. They do however turn out to be exactly the Hanner corners.\n\n\nAntiblocking bodies\nA body \\(B\\) is antiblocking if its restriction to any orthant is an unconditional corner.\nThe Mahler conjecture for those now follows from a simple application of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.\nLet \\(v, v^*\\in\\Bbb R^{\\{0,1\\}^n}\\) be vectors with entries\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nv_\\sigma&:=\\operatorname{vol}(B\\cap \\Bbb R^n_\\sigma)\n\\\\\nv_\\sigma^*&:=\\operatorname{vol}(B^\\circ\\cap \\Bbb R^n_\\sigma)\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThen\n\\[\nM(B) = \\operatorname{vol}(B)\\cdot\\operatorname{vol}(B^\\circ)=\\Big(\\sum_\\sigma v_\\sigma\\Big)\\cdot\\Big(\\sum_\\sigma v_\\sigma^*\\Big) \\ge \\Big(\\sum_\\sigma \\sqrt{v_\\sigma v_\\sigma^*}\\Big)^2 \\ge \\Big(\\frac{2^n}{\\sqrt{d!}}\\Big)^2 = \\frac{4^d}{d!}.\n\\]\nThe locally antiblocking minimizers turn out to be locally Hanner polytopes."

Equivalently (though not trivially so) zonotopes can be defined as Minkowski sums of line segments.\nA polytope is inscribed if all its vertices lie on a sphere.\nBoth zonotopes and inscribed polytopes are abundant, but it turns out that asking for both at the same time is surprisingly restrictive. In fact, only 17 are known in dimension three (+ an infinite family of prisms), yet we can’t even show that there are finitely many (ignoring the prisms). But let’s move slowly.\nSome examples come to mind easily: the cube, prisms, and perhaps even the permutahedron. All those actually share a property much stronger than being inscribed: they are vertex-transitive, that is, their orthogonal symmetry group acts transitively on the vertices.\n…\nIn [1] I showed the vertex those are exactly the \\(\\Gamma\\)-permutahedra, where \\(\\Gamma\\) is a finite reflection group.\nA vertex-transitive zonotope might have realizations that are inscribed but not vertex-transitive. For example, the \\(A_3\\)-zonotope can be realized as an inscribed zonotope with any of the following generators:\n\\[\\alpha_i\\alpha_j (\\alpha_i e_j-\\alpha_j e_i)\\]\nIn contrast, the \\(H_3\\)-zonotope can be realized as an inscribed zonotope in exactly one way, which is then vertex-transitive.\nSanyal and Manecke noted that the projection of an isncribed zonotope along an edge direction yields again an inscribed zonotope. Starting from higher-dimensional \\(\\Gamma\\)-permutahedra this gives rise to many inscribed zonotopes of new combinatorial types. I like to call them quasi-permutahedra. All in all they found 17 combinatorial types for which they generated the graphics below.\nThey also gave the following diagram showing the realtios between the different quasi-permutahedra.\nIt should be noted that all inscribed zonotopes are simple, that is, their graph is regular and the degree is exactly the dimension. As such, the hyperplane arrangement that corresponds the the zonotope (i.e. the arrangement whose normal vectors are the edge directions) is simplicial. Simplicial hyperplane arrangements are a beast on their own and form their own exclusive club. The “trivial” examples are the reflection arrangements. The most up-to-date list in dimension three is due to Grünbaum and Cuntz and list 93 arrangements + 3 infinite families. Sanyal and Manecke verified that only the quasi-reflection arrangements (the ones obtained by restriction of a reflection arrangements to a hyperplane) lead to inscribed zonotopes (on the way they verified that all the known arrangements are projectively unique!). They did however find that some arrangements lead to strange “zonotope-like” objects that are inscribed not in a sphere, but a different quadric!"

    "title": "The double kissing problem",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Famously Isaac Newton and David Gregory disagreed over the maximal number of disjoint unit spheres that can simultaneously touch a central unit sphere. Newton claimed it to be 12, while Gregory thought that a 13-th sphere can fit. It took several centuries to show that Newton was right. Here is your chance to be part of a dispute just like that: make you guess for the double kissing problem. \n\nThe kissing number is the maximal number of disjoint (3-dimensional) unit spheres that can touch a common central unit sphere. Today we know the answer is 12. Some optimal solutions have noticable gaps between the outer spheres (see the right figure below) which made people wonder whther a 13-th sphere could fit.\n\nThe double kissing problem replaces the central sphere with two spheres:\n\nGiven two touching unit spheres, what is the maximal number of disjoint unit spheres that can be arranged so that each touches at least one of the central spheres?\n\nIt is not hard to come up with an arrangement of 18 spheres by cutting out a part of the fcc lattice (or A3 lattice):\n\nAs of writing this article, it seems that a 19-th sphere cannot made fit.\nHowever, in 2015 Moritz Firsching found that by shrinking the outer spheres by a tiny amount, to a radius of not less than 0.99, we actually can fit a 19-th sphere! Here is an animation of this arrangement based on coordinates provided by him on MathOverflow:\n\n\n\nWhile I am still rooting for double kissing number 18, this 19-sphere arrangement made me pessimistic regarding the existence of a slick argument for this.\nThe double kissing problem was initially brought to my attention by Florian Theil. In his paper “Face-Centered Cubic Crystallization of Atomistic Configurations” with Lisa Flatley they showed that the fcc lattice is (asymptotically) an energy minimizer for suitably chosen 2- and 3-point potentials. 2-point potentials (that is, the energy depends on the distance between pairs of particles) are familiar from the classical electrostatic and gravitation forces. In contrast, 3-point potentials (the energy depends on the distances in triples of particles) struck me as less natural (though Florian explained to me that they are not unphysical). In fact, Flatley and Theil conjecture that the 3-point potentials are actually not necessary for their result. They can prove this conditional on a new Conjecture 2.2, which reads (in my words):\n\nConjecture (Flatley, Theil, 2015)  Given a packing of unit sphere in which each sphere touches exactly 12 other spheres, then for any pair of touching spheres there are at least four spheres that touch both of them.\n\nIf the double kissing number were 18, then this would answers their conjecture affirmatively: let \\(B_0,B_1\\) be two touching spheres in an arrangement as in the conjecture, and let \\(N_i\\) be the set of spheres touching \\(B_i\\) (excluding \\(B_{1-i}\\)) then \\(|N_i|=11\\), \\(|N_0\\cup N_1|\\le 18\\), and\n\\[|N_0\\cap N_1| = |N_0|+|N_1|-|N_0\\cup N_1| \\ge 11+11-18 = 4.\\]\nTheir Conjecture 2.2 makes much stronger assumptions than the general double kissing problem and might therefore be more accessible. Note that in the animation of the 19-spheres configuration, there is not a single sphere that touches both central spheres. This is possible since the central spheres are not touched by 12 spheres each, but by 11 and 10 other spheres respectively (including the other central sphere)."

For convex sets \\(B_1\\subset\\Bbb R^{d_1}\\) and \\(B_2\\subset\\Bbb R^{d_2}\\) we write \\(B_1 \\star B_2 \\subset \\Bbb R^{d_1}\\times\\Bbb R^{d_2}\\times\\Bbb R\\cong \\Bbb R^{d_1+d_2+1}\\) for the result of the following construction:\n\nconsider \\(\\Bbb R^{d_1+d_2+1}=\\operatorname{span}\\{e_0;e_1^1,...,e_{d_1}^1;e_1^2,...,e_{d_2}^2\\}\\) and define the following affine subspaces:  \\[\nH_i=x_i e_0 + \\operatorname{span}\\{e_{1}^i,...,e_{d_2}^i\\}.\n\\]\nembed \\(c_i B_i\\) into \\(H_i\\) with the origin mapped to \\(x_i e_0\\).\nthe convex hull of both embedded sets is the result of the operation.\n\nThe other direction requires some preparation. Let \\(B_1\\star B_2 \\subset\\Bbb R^{2d+1}\\) denote the join of convex bodies \\(B_1,B_2\\subset\\Bbb R^d\\). For our purpose we need that the join is constructed geometrically as follows: first we embed the \\(B_i\\) into two specific \\(d\\)-dimensional affine subspaces of \\(\\Bbb R^{2d+1}\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nH_1 &= -e_0 + \\operatorname{span}\\{e_1,...,e_d\\},\n\\\\\nH_2 &= \\phantom+ e_0 + \\operatorname{span}\\{e_{d+1},...,e_{2d}\\},\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nso that the origin in \\(B_i\\) is mapped to \\(\\pm e_0\\) respectively. The join \\(B_1\\star B_2\\) is then the convex hull of the embedded sets.\nWe make three obsevations.\n(1) Volume\nThe volume of \\(B_1\\star B_2\\) can be computed as as follows: the section of \\(B_1\\star B_2\\) with the hyperplane \\(e_0^\\bot + se_0, s\\in[-1,1]\\) is of the form \\(t B_1\\times (1-t) B_2\\) with \\(t=\\frac12(s+1)\\in[0,1]\\). Thus\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\vol(B_1\\star B_2)\n    &= \\phantom 2\\!\\int_{-1}^1 \\!\\!\\vol\\big((B_1\\star B_2) \\cap (e_0^\\bot+ s e_0)\\big) \\,\\mathrm ds\n\\\\ &= 2\\! \\int_0^1 \\!\\!\\vol(t B_1\\times (1-t) B_2) \\,\\mathrm dt\n\\\\ &= \\vol(B_1)\\cdot \\vol(B_2) \\cdot \\underbrace{2\\!\\int_0^1 \\!\\!t(1-t) \\,\\mathrm dt}_{=: c}.\n    = c\\cdot \\vol(B_1)\\cdot\\vol(B_2).\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n(2) Polarity\nThe specific gemetric realization of the join chosen here commutes with polarity: \\[(B_1\\star B_2)^\\circ=B_1^\\circ\\star B_2^\\circ.\\] In particular, \\(B\\star B^\\circ\\) is self-polar!\n(2) Simplices\nSimplices are closed under the join operation. If \\(\\Delta_d\\) denotes a \\(d\\)-dimensional simplex, then\n\\[\\Delta_d\\star\\Delta_e \\simeq \\Delta_{d+e+1}.\\]\n\n\\(s=(1-t)a+tb = a + (b-a)t\\).\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\vol(A\\star B)\n    &= \\int_a^b \\!\\vol\\!\\big((A\\star B)\\cap H_s\\big) \\,\\mathrm ds\n  \\\\&= (b-a)\\cdot \\int_0^1 \\!\\vol\\!\\big((1-t)\\alpha A+t \\beta B\\big) \\,\\mathrm dt\n  \\rlap{\\quad \\text{\\small\\color{lightgray} (using $\\tfrac{\\mathrm ds}{\\mathrm dt}=b-a$)}}\n  \\\\&= (b-a) \\cdot\\alpha^{d_A}\\beta^{d_B} \\cdot\\vol(A)\\cdot\\vol(B)\\cdot \\int_0^1 (1-t)^{d_A}t^{d_B} \\,\\mathrm dt\n  \\\\&= \\underbrace{\\alpha^{d_A}\\beta^{d_B}\\cdot(b-a)\\cdot\\frac{(d_A+1)!(d_B+1)!}{(d_A+d_B+1)!}}_{=:\\,K(a,b;\\alpha,\\beta;d_A,d_B)} \\cdot\\vol(A)\\cdot\\vol(B).\n\\end{align}\n\\]"

    "text": "The Mahler conjecture is usually stated for centrally symmetric convex bodies. However, its non-symmetric version seems equally interesting and seemingly intractable. As it turns out, this version has a neat formulation in terms of the volume (not Mahler volume) of self-polar bodies. \\(\\DeclareMathOperator{\\vol}{vol}\\)\n\nGiven a centrally symmetric convex body \\(B\\subset\\Bbb R^d\\), Kurt Mahler defined the following linearly invariant “notion of volume”, now known as the Mahler volume:\n\\[\nM(B):=\\operatorname{vol}(B)\\cdot\\operatorname{vol}(B^\\circ).\n\\]\nHere \\(B^\\circ:=\\{y\\in\\Bbb R^d\\mid \\langle x,y\\rangle\\le 1\\text{ for all }x\\in B\\}\\) denotes the polar dual of \\(B\\). It has long been known that the Mahler volume is maximized for the sphere (this is known as the Blaschke-Santaló inequality). In contrast, the minimizers seem elusive. It has equally long been conjectured that the cube has the minimal Mahler volume: for every centrally symmetric convex body \\(B\\subset\\Bbb R^d\\) holds\n\\[M(B)\\ge M(\\text{$d$-cube}) = \\frac{4^d}{d!}.\\]\nThis is known as the Mahler conjecture, which, as of today, remains open. In his blog post Terrence Tao makes a suggestion for why the conjecture might be so hard:\n\nIn my opinion, the main reason why this conjecture is so difficult is that unlike the upper bound, in which there is essentially only one extremiser up to affine transformations (namely the ball), there are many distinct extremisers for the lower bound – not only the cube and the octahedron, but also products of cubes and octahedra, polar bodies of products of cubes and octahedra, products of polar bodies of … well, you get the idea. It is really difficult to conceive of any sort of flow or optimisation procedure which would converge to exactly these bodies and no others […]\n\n(this family of conjectured extremizers he refers to is known as the Hanner polytopes)\nThere is however an easy way to see that the multitude of minimizers cannot be the true or only reason here: by dropping the assumption of central symmetry we obtain the non-symmetric Mahler conjecture. It asserts that the simplex minimizes the Mahler volume among all convex bodies:\n\\[M(B)\\ge M(\\text{$d$-simplex}) = \\frac{(d+1)^{d+1}}{(d!)^2}.\\]\nThis conjecture has turned out equally intractable. Yet, since we expect the simplex to be the unique minimizer, Terry’s explanation cannot apply.\nWe briefly addres an important technicality with the non-symmetric version: computing the Mahler volume requires computing the polar body, which is not a translation invariant construction. If \\(B\\) is centrally symmetric, there is a preferred choice of origin (the symmetry center). For a general body there is no such preferred choice and computing the Mahler volume requires fixing the bodies location relative to the origin. However, there exists a unique point \\(x\\in P\\) (the Sataló point) that, if chosen as the origin, minimizes the Mahler volume.\n\nA formulation in terms of self-polar bodies\nThe goal here is to reformulate the non-symmetric Mahler conjecture in terms of volumes of self-polar bodies, thereby avoiding volume products entirely.\n\nA convex body \\(B\\) is self-polar if \\(B\\) and \\(B^\\circ\\) are isometric (or equivalently, related by an orthogonal transformation). An example is the unit ball; not however a ball of any other radius: if \\(B\\) is a ball of radius \\(r\\) then \\(B^\\circ\\) has radius \\(1/r\\), which is non-isometric to \\(B\\). We see that self-polarity cares about scale. Another example is a simplex, if chosen of a suitable shape and scale. In this case \\(B=-B^\\circ\\).\nThe following conjecture is equivalent to the non-symmetric Mahler conjecture:\n\nConjecture.  The simplex has the smallest volume among all self-polar bodies.\n\nOne direction of the equivalence is straight-forward: if \\(B\\) is self-polar, then\n\\[\\llap{(*)\\qquad}M(B)=\\vol(B)\\cdot\\vol(B^\\circ)=\\vol(B)^2.\\]\nHence, if simplices minimizes \\(M(\\,\\cdot\\,)\\), then since they are also self-polar, \\((*)\\) simplices also minimize \\(\\vol(\\,\\cdot\\,)\\) among all self-polar bodies.\nFor the other direction we need to recall the join operation \\(B_1\\star B_2\\), and the following properties:\n\nif \\(B_1,B_2\\) are of dimension \\(d_1,d_2\\) respectively, then \\(B_1\\star B_2\\) is of dimension \\(d_1+d_2+1\\).\nwe can explicitle compute the volume of joins: \\[\\vol(B_1\\star B_2) = c(d_1,d_2)\\cdot \\vol(B_1)\\cdot\\vol(B_2),\\]where \\(c(d_1,d_2)\\) depends on the dimensions of the bodies, but not on the bodies themselves.\njoins commute with the polar dual operation: \\((B_1\\star B_2)^\\circ = B_1^\\circ\\star B_2^\\circ\\). In particular, \\(B\\star B^\\circ\\) is always a self-polar body!\njoins of simplices yield simplices: \\(\\Delta_{d_1}\\star\\Delta_{d_2} = \\Delta_{d_1+d_2+1}\\). Moreover, if we start from simplices in their self-polar realization of minimal volume, the join is also a self-polar simplex in self-polar realization of minimal volume.\n\nFormulating these properties precisely requires some more care and a carefully chosen geometric realization of the join. See my previous blog entry on the join for the details.\nSuppose then that \\(P\\) is a counterexample to the non-symmetric Mahler conjecture, that is, \\(M(P)&lt;M(\\Delta_d)\\). Then \\(P\\star P^\\circ\\) is a self-polar polytope with\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\vol(P\\star P^\\circ) &= c\\cdot \\vol(P)\\cdot \\vol(P^\\circ)\n\\\\ &= c\\cdot M(P)\n\\\\ &&lt; c \\cdot M(\\Delta_d)\n\\\\ &= c \\cdot \\vol(\\Delta_d)\\cdot\\vol(\\Delta_d^\\circ)\n\\\\ &= c \\cdot \\vol(\\Delta_d)\\cdot\\vol(\\Delta_d)\n\\\\ &= \\vol(\\Delta_d\\star\\Delta_d)\n= \\vol(\\Delta_{2d+1}).\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nthat is, a counterexample to Conjecture A. Conversely, Conjecture A implies the non-symmetric Mahler conjecture.\nConversely, suppose that \\(P\\) is a self-polar polytope with \\(\\vol(P)&lt;\\vol(\\Delta_d)\\). Then\n\\[M(B)=\\vol(B)\\cdot\\vol(B^\\circ)=\\vol(B)^2 \\ge \\vol(\\Delta_d)^2=\\vol(\\Delta_d)\\cdot\\vol(\\Delta_d^\\circ) = M(\\Delta_d),\\]\nwhich is a counterexample to the non-symmetric Mahler conjecture.\nSelf-polar polytopes are not very well understood. For example, it is unknown whether every self-dual polytope has a self-polar realization.\nFinally, I am not aware of an analogous formulation for the symmetric Mahler conjecture. Of course, one could ask for the smallest volume of a convex body of the form \\(B*B^\\circ\\), whether \\(B\\) is centrally symmetric. This however feels not like a significant reformulation and does not have the charme of a natural problem on its own."
