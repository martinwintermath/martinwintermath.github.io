    "title": "The double kissing problem",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Famously Isaac Newton and David Gregory disagreed over the maximal number of disjoint unit spheres that can simultaneously touch a central unit sphere. Newton claimed it to be 12, while Gregory thought that a 13-th sphere can fit. It took several centuries to show that Newton was right. Here is your chance to be part of a dispute just like that: make your guess for the double kissing problem.\n\nThe kissing number is the maximal number of disjoint (3-dimensional) unit spheres that can touch a common central unit sphere. Today we know the answer is 12. Some optimal solutions have noticable gaps between the outer spheres (see the right figure below) which made people wonder whther a 13-th sphere could fit.\n\nThe double kissing problem replaces the central sphere with two spheres:\n\nGiven two touching unit spheres, what is the maximal number of disjoint unit spheres that can be arranged so that each touches at least one of the central spheres?\n\nIt is not hard to come up with an arrangement of 18 spheres by cutting out a part of the fcc lattice (or A3 lattice):\n\nAs of writing this article, it seems that a 19-th sphere cannot made fit.\nHowever, in 2015 Moritz Firsching found that by shrinking the outer spheres by a tiny amount, to a radius of not less than 0.99, we actually can fit a 19-th sphere! Here is an animation of this arrangement based on coordinates provided by him on MathOverflow:\n\n\n\nWhile I am still rooting for double kissing number 18, this 19-sphere arrangement made me pessimistic regarding the existence of a slick argument for this.\nThe double kissing problem was initially brought to my attention by Florian Theil. In his paper “Face-Centered Cubic Crystallization of Atomistic Configurations” with Lisa Flatley they showed that the fcc lattice is (asymptotically) an energy minimizer for suitably chosen 2- and 3-point potentials. 2-point potentials (that is, the energy depends on the distance between pairs of particles) are familiar from the classical electrostatic and gravitation forces. In contrast, 3-point potentials (the energy depends on the distances in triples of particles) struck me as less natural (though Florian explained to me that they are not unphysical). In fact, Flatley and Theil conjecture that the 3-point potentials are actually not necessary for their result. They can prove this conditional on a new Conjecture 2.2, which reads (in my words):\n\nConjecture (Flatley, Theil, 2015)  Given a packing of unit sphere in which each sphere touches exactly 12 other spheres, then for any pair of touching spheres there are at least four spheres that touch both of them.\n\nIf the double kissing number were 18, then this would answers their conjecture affirmatively: let \\(B_0,B_1\\) be two touching spheres in an arrangement as in the conjecture, and let \\(N_i\\) be the set of spheres touching \\(B_i\\) (excluding \\(B_{1-i}\\)) then \\(|N_i|=11\\), \\(|N_0\\cup N_1|\\le 18\\), and\n\\[|N_0\\cap N_1| = |N_0|+|N_1|-|N_0\\cup N_1| \\ge 11+11-18 = 4.\\]\nTheir Conjecture 2.2 makes much stronger assumptions than the general double kissing problem and might therefore be more accessible. Note that in the animation of the 19-spheres configuration, there is not a single sphere that touches both central spheres. This is possible since the central spheres are not touched by 12 spheres each, but by 11 and 10 other spheres respectively (including the other central sphere)."

    "text": "I taught this TCC course on “Polytope Theory” starting from October 10th 2022 for 8 weeks. Due to the nature of TCC courses (being streamed to several universities) this was an online course taught via MS Teams.\n\nIntroduction\nPolytope Theory is the study of (convex) polytopes, the generalization of polygons (2D) and polyhedra (3D) to general dimension. Besides their geometric nature as convex sets, polytopes possess a rich combinatorial structure, making them exceptionally accessible by combinatorial techniques. The study of polytopes reaches from the antiquity (starting from the Platonic solids), over the 19th/20th century (understanding polytopes in 3D and initializing the study of polytopes in dimension \\(\\ge 3\\)), until today, where we understand that the richness of polytopal phenomena starts in dimension 4 and which led to findings such as universality. The subject has shown proximity to algebraic geometry, representation theory, analysis, optimization and many more.\n\n\nScope\nIn this course I aimed to give an overview of this very diverse subject and cover selected topics with focus towards research and open questions.

    "title": "Tuning the geometric join",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The join is a well-known and rather general operation – it works on topological spaces, simplicial complexes, subsets of \\(\\Bbb R^n\\), polytopes and many others. I want to collect here some facts about joins that are perhaps not so well-known. This is also in preparation for an upcoming blog post on the non-symmetric Mahler conjecture. \\(\\DeclareMathOperator{\\vol}{vol}\\)\n\n\nThe join is an operation defined on objects as general as topological spaces. Given topological spaces \\(X\\), \\(Y\\), their join \\(X\\star Y\\) is defined as \\(X\\times [-1,1]\\times Y\\) quotiented by \\(x\\times\\{-1\\}\\times Y\\) for all \\(x\\in X\\) and \\(X\\times \\{1\\}\\times y\\) for all \\(y\\in Y\\). Already in this form it comes with some nice properties, e.g. \\(\\Bbb S^{d_1}\\star \\Bbb S^{d_2} \\simeq\\Bbb S^{d_1+d_2+1}\\).\nIf \\(X_i\\subset\\Bbb R^{d_i}\\) then \\(X_1\\star X_2\\) can be realized as a subset of \\(\\Bbb R^{d_1}\\times\\Bbb R\\times \\Bbb R^{d_2}\\cong\\Bbb R^{d_1+d_2+1}\\) as follows: embedd \\(X_1,X_2\\) into \\(\\Bbb R^{d_1+d_2+1}\\) so that their affine spans are disjoint. Then embed \\((x,t,y)\\) as \\((1-t)x+ty\\).\nIf the \\(X_i\\) are convex bodies, then this yields precisely the convex hull of \\(X_1^\\star\\cup X_2^\\star\\),in partiucular, is itself realized as a convex set.\nIf the \\(P_i\\) are polytopes, then their join \\(P_1\\star P_2\\) is a polytope whose combinatorics depends only on the combinatorics of the \\(P_i\\). Therefore, the join can also be defined as an operation on (face) lattices \\(\\mathcal P_i\\). In this form, some interesting properties are:\n\nthe join of simplices yields a simplex: \\(\\Delta_{d_1}\\star \\Delta_{d_2}\\simeq\\Delta_{d_1+d_2+1}\\) (combinatorially clear, just count the number of vertices).\nthe join commutes with duality: \\((\\mathcal P_1\\star \\mathcal P_2)^*\\simeq \\mathcal P_1^*\\star \\mathcal P_2^*\\), where \\(\\mathcal P^*\\) denotes combinatorial dual to the lattice \\(\\mathcal P\\) (i.e. turning it up side down).\n\nIt is now a good exercise to see whether these properties can be made work in the geometric setting as well. For example, if \\(0\\in P_i\\), can we have \\((P_1\\star P_2)^\\circ=P_1^\\circ\\star P_2^\\circ\\)? Can we have that the join of regular simplices is regular? How to compute the volume of \\(P_1\\star P_2\\)? These particular questions are inspired by their application to the non-symmetric Mahler conjecture in this blog article.\n\nIf the spaces are subsets \\(X_1\\subset\\Bbb R^{d_1}\\) and \\(X_2\\subset\\Bbb R^{d_2}\\), then the join \\(X_1\\star X_2\\) can be realized as a subset of \\(\\Bbb R^{d_1}\\times\\Bbb R\\times\\Bbb R^{d_2}\\cong\\Bbb R^{D}\\) (where \\(D=d_1+d_2+1\\)): embed \\(X_1\\) and \\(X_2\\) into \\(\\Bbb R^D\\) so that their affine spans are disjoint, and then mapping \\((a,t,b)\\) to \\((1-t)a+tb\\).\nLet’s be more precise. We fix disjoint subspaces \\(H_1,H_2\\subset \\Bbb R^{D}\\) of dimension \\(d_1,d_2\\) respectively, as well as isomorphisms \\(\\phi_i:\\Bbb R^{d_i}\\xrightarrow{\\sim} H_i\\).\n\nThe faces of \\(P_1\\star P_2\\) are of the form \\(\\sigma_1\\star \\sigma_2\\), where \\(\\sigma_i\\in\\mathcal F(P_i)\\). Hence, the f-vector of the join is\n\\[f_k(P_1\\star P_2)= \\sum_{i+j=k} f_i(P_1)f_j(P_2).\\]\nIn particular, the faces can be indexed by pairs \\((\\sigma_1,\\sigma_2)\\) and the face lattice structure can be recovered via\n\\[(\\sigma_1,\\sigma_2)\\preceq (\\tau_1,\\tau_2) \\;:\\Longleftarrow\\; \\sigma_1\\preceq \\tau_1\\,\\land\\,\\sigma_2\\preceq\\tau_2.\\]\nIn fact, the face lattice of the join is merely the product of the individual face lattices (in the sense of the usual product order). From this it is easy to see that\n\\[\\big(\\mathcal F(P_1)\\star \\mathcal F(P_2)\\big)^{\\mathrm{op}} \\simeq \\mathcal F(P_1)^{\\mathrm{op}}\\star\\mathcal F(P_2)^{\\mathrm{op}}.\\]\n\nLet’s fix parameter \\(x_1,x_2,c_1,c_2\\in\\Bbb R\\). For convex sets \\(B_1\\subset\\Bbb R^{d_1}\\) and \\(B_2\\subset\\Bbb R^{d_2}\\) we write \\(B_1 \\star B_2 \\subset \\Bbb R^{d_1}\\times\\Bbb R^{d_2}\\times\\Bbb R\\cong \\Bbb R^{d_1+d_2+1}\\) for the result of the following construction:\n\nconsider \\(\\Bbb R^{d_1+d_2+1}=\\operatorname{span}\\{e_0;e_1^1,...,e_{d_1}^1;e_1^2,...,e_{d_2}^2\\}\\) and define the following affine subspaces:  \\[\nH_i=x_i e_0 + \\operatorname{span}\\{e_{1}^i,...,e_{d_2}^i\\}.\n\\]\nembed \\(c_i B_i\\) into \\(H_i\\) with the origin mapped to \\(x_i e_0\\).\nthe convex hull of both embedded sets is the result of the operation.\n\nThe other direction requires some preparation. Let \\(B_1\\star B_2 \\subset\\Bbb R^{2d+1}\\) denote the join of convex bodies \\(B_1,B_2\\subset\\Bbb R^d\\). For our purpose we need that the join is constructed geometrically as follows: first we embed the \\(B_i\\) into two specific \\(d\\)-dimensional affine subspaces of \\(\\Bbb R^{2d+1}\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nH_1 &= -e_0 + \\operatorname{span}\\{e_1,...,e_d\\},\n\\\\\nH_2 &= \\phantom+ e_0 + \\operatorname{span}\\{e_{d+1},...,e_{2d}\\},\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nso that the origin in \\(B_i\\) is mapped to \\(\\pm e_0\\) respectively. The join \\(B_1\\star B_2\\) is then the convex hull of the embedded sets.\nWe make three obsevations.\n(1) Volume\nThe volume of \\(B_1\\star B_2\\) can be computed as as follows: the section of \\(B_1\\star B_2\\) with the hyperplane \\(e_0^\\bot + se_0, s\\in[-1,1]\\) is of the form \\(t B_1\\times (1-t) B_2\\) with \\(t=\\frac12(s+1)\\in[0,1]\\). Thus\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\vol(B_1\\star B_2)\n    &= \\phantom 2\\!\\int_{-1}^1 \\!\\!\\vol\\big((B_1\\star B_2) \\cap (e_0^\\bot+ s e_0)\\big) \\,\\mathrm ds\n\\\\ &= 2\\! \\int_0^1 \\!\\!\\vol(t B_1\\times (1-t) B_2) \\,\\mathrm dt\n\\\\ &= \\vol(B_1)\\cdot \\vol(B_2) \\cdot \\underbrace{2\\!\\int_0^1 \\!\\!t(1-t) \\,\\mathrm dt}_{=: c}.\n    = c\\cdot \\vol(B_1)\\cdot\\vol(B_2).\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n(2) Polarity\nThe specific gemetric realization of the join chosen here commutes with polarity: \\[(B_1\\star B_2)^\\circ=B_1^\\circ\\star B_2^\\circ.\\] In particular, \\(B\\star B^\\circ\\) is self-polar!\n(2) Simplices\nSimplices are closed under the join operation.

While famously open, several proofs have been discovered for the special case of coordinate symmetric bodies. I want to share here a very short and elegant proof by Mathieu Meyer that seems otherwise unavailable in the English litrature. \\(\\DeclareMathOperator{\\vol}{vol}\\)\n\n\nLet \\(B\\subset\\Bbb R^n\\) be a centrally symmetric convex body, where we shall assume \\(-B=B\\). Kurt Mahler defined the following linearly invariant notion of volume now known as Mahler volume:\n\\[\nM(B):=\\operatorname{vol}(B)\\operatorname{vol}(B^\\circ).\n\\]\nHere \\(B^\\circ:=\\{y\\in\\Bbb R^n\\mid \\langle x,y\\rangle\\le 1\\text{ for all }x\\in B\\}\\) denotes the polar dual of \\(B\\). It has long been known that the Mahler volume attains a maximum for the sphere. There are also clear ideas for what might minimize the Mahler volume, but a proof remains elusive. This is the infamous Mahler conjecture, which remains open to this day:\n\nMahler conjecture.  For each centrally symmetric convex body \\(B\\subset\\Bbb R^n\\) holds \\[M(B)\\ge M(\\text{$n$-cube}) = \\smash{\\frac{4^n}{n!}}.\\]\n\nBelow I share a very elegant proof for the special case of coordinate symmetric bodies that, I believe, is not available in the English literature elsewhere. For some general background on the Mahler conjecture as well as its status, check out the Wikipedia article and Terry Tao’s blog entry on the topic.\n\nCoordinate symmetric bodies and convex corners\nA convex body \\(B\\subset\\Bbb R^n\\) is coordinate symmetric if it is invariant under reflection on each coordinate hyperplane \\(H_i:=\\{x_i=0\\}\\). Clearly, coordinate symmetric bodies are centrally symmetric and closed under polarity.  \n\nIn the literature these bodies are often called “unconditional bodies”, a term going back to “unconditional convergence” mostly used in Banach space theory. For geometric (that is, finite-dimensional) discussions I prefer to go with the more visually inspired term “coordinate symmetric”.\nA coordinate symmetric body \\(B\\) is clearly determined by its restriction \\(B_+:=B\\cap\\Bbb R^n_+\\) to the positive orthant \\(\\Bbb R_+^n:=\\{x_i\\ge 0\\}\\). A set \\(B_+\\subset\\Bbb R^n_+\\) that can be written as such a restriction of a coordinate symmetric body is called a convex corner (also known as an anti-blocking body).\n\nConvex corners are in one-to-one correspondence with coordinate symmetric bodies. We prove the Mahler conjecture for coordinate symmetric bodies by formulating and proving a version on convex corners.\nFirst, we need a notion of polar duality that works for convex corners. If \\(B_+:= B\\cap\\Bbb R^n_+\\) then\n\\[B_+^* := \\{x\\in\\Bbb R^n_+\\mid \\langle x,y\\rangle\\le 1 \\text{ for all } y\\in B_+\\} = B^\\circ\\cap\\Bbb R^n_+.\\]\nSince a coordinate symmetric body consists of \\(2^n\\) identical copies of its convex corner, it is sufficient to prove the following:\n\nTheorem.  For each convex corner \\(B_+\\subset\\Bbb R^n_+\\) holds \\[M_+(B_+):=\\operatorname{vol}(B_+)\\operatorname{vol}(B_+^*) \\ge \\smash{\\frac1{n!}}.\\]\n\n\n\nProving the Mahler conjecture for convex corners\nThe following very short and elegant proof is due to Mathieu Meyer from his 1986 article Une caractérisation volumique de certains espaces normés. It was brought to my attention by Raman Sanyal, whose presentation of the proof I follow below.\nLet \\(B_i:=B_+\\cap\\{x_i=0\\}\\) and \\(B_i^*:=B_+^*\\cap \\{x_i=0\\}\\), and observe that those are themselves convex corners of dimension \\(n-1\\). Define vectors \\(v,v^*\\in\\Bbb R^n\\) with components\n\\[v_i := \\frac{\\operatorname{vol}_{n-1}(B_i)}{n \\operatorname{vol}_{n}(B_+)},\\quad\\; v_i^* := \\frac{\\operatorname{vol}_{n-1}(B_i^*)}{n \\operatorname{vol}_{n}(B_+^*)}\\]\n(where we put dimension subscripts on the volume for clarity). For a point \\(x\\in \\Bbb R_+^n\\) the inner product \\(\\langle x,v\\rangle\\) evaluates to\n\\[\n\\langle x,v\\rangle\n= \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\\frac{\\operatorname{vol}_{n-1}(B_i)}{n \\operatorname{vol}_n(B_+)}\n= \\frac1{\\operatorname{vol}_{n}(B_+)} \\cdot \\sum_{i=1}^n \\underbrace{\\tfrac1n{x_i \\operatorname{vol}_{n-1}(B_i)}}_{\\operatorname{vol}_n(C_i)},\n\\]\nwhere \\(C_i\\) is the cone with base face \\(B_i\\) and apex at \\(x\\).\n\nIf \\(x\\in B_+\\) then the cones \\(C_i\\) have disjoint interiors and are contained in \\(B_+\\). In particular, the sum of their volumes is bounded by \\(\\operatorname{vol}_n(B_+)\\). Therefore \\(\\langle x,v\\rangle \\le 1\\) for all \\(x\\in B_+\\), and hence \\(v\\in B_+^*\\). By an analogous argument holds \\(v^*\\in B_+\\). Hence, we can conclude\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n1\\,\\ge\\, &\\langle v,v^*\\rangle\n=  \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{\\operatorname{vol}_{n-1}(B_i)\\operatorname{vol}_{n-1}(B_i^*)}{n^2\\operatorname{vol}_n(B_+)\\operatorname{vol}_n(B_+^*)}\n= \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{M_+(B_i)}{n^2M_+(B_+)}.\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nBy rearranging and applying the induction hypothesis \\(M_+(B_i)\\ge 1/(n-1)!\\) we obtain\n\\[\nM_+(B_+) \\ge \\frac1{n^2} \\sum_{i=1}^n M_+(B_i) \\ge \\frac1{n^2} \\cdot\\frac{n}{(n-1)!} = \\frac1{n!}.\n\\]\nFrom this proof one can also extract the minimizers. Those turn out to be precisely the Hanner corners (that is, the positive corners obtained from the conjectured minimizers of the Mahler conjecture, the Hanner polytopes). In particular, the minimizers among the coordinate symmetric polytopes are indeed the Hanner polytopes.\n\n\nIt’s not about central symmetry anymore\nIt turns out, once the problem is solved for convex corners, there is no longer any need to piece them together into a coordinate symmetric body to satisfy the Mahler conjecture. Even crazier, we don’t even need central symmetry anymore!\nA locally anti-blocking body (this is the official term, I don’t have a good alterantive name for this one yet) is a convex body that if restricted to each orthant yields a convex corner.\n\nLocally anti-blocking bodies are a much richer family of bodie as compared to the highly symmetric coordinate symmetric bodies. In fact, they need not even be centrally symmetric! Still, they are closed under polar duality and share a number of nice properties with coordinate symmetric bodies.\nThe Mahler conjecture for a locally anti-blocking bodies follows from a simple application of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality: for \\(\\sigma\\in\\{-1,+1\\}^n\\) and \\(x\\in\\Bbb R^n\\) write \\(\\sigma x:=(\\sigma_1 x_1,...,\\sigma_n x_n)\\). For a locally anti-blocking body \\(B\\) define\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nw_\\sigma&:=\\operatorname{vol}(\\sigma B\\cap \\Bbb R^n_+),\\quad\nw_\\sigma^*:=\\operatorname{vol}(\\sigma B^\\circ\\cap \\Bbb R^n_+)\n\\end{align},\n\\]\nwhich are precisely the volumes of its \\(2^n\\) convex corners. Using Cauchy-Schwarz (CS) and the proof for convex corners \\((*)\\), we conclude\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nM(B)\n= \\operatorname{vol}(B)\\operatorname{vol}(B^\\circ)\n&=\\Big(\\sum_\\sigma w_\\sigma\\Big)\\Big(\\sum_\\sigma w_\\sigma^*\\Big)\n\\\\&\\!\\overset{\\text{(CS)}}\\ge \\Big(\\sum_\\sigma \\sqrt{w_\\sigma w_\\sigma^*}\\Big)^2\n\\overset{(*)}\\ge \\Big(\\frac{2^n}{\\sqrt{n!}}\\Big)^2 = \\frac{4^n}{n!}.\n\\end{align}.\n\\]\nIn this case, the minimizers are not necessarily Hanner (since not necessarily centrally symmetric), but more generally, are locally Hanner. This means that they yield Hanner corners if restricted to any orthant."
